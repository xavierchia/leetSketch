# Leet Sketch

A simple application to help my girlfriend Ally learn sketching. 

### Requirements:
1. It should provide feedback on your drawing. [DONE]
2. It should have a grid option. [DONE]
3. It should work cross-device [DONE]

### Demo:

### Reflection:
1. App has positive response from users
2. App would work better as native on tablet with a stylus
3. A decent prototype can be built in 26 hours with only basic front-end tools
